# `easypypi`
- Want to share your Python script(s) on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI*) so others can just `pip install yourscript`?
- Daunted by the numerous, dry, tutorials and conflicting information online regarding `distutils` and `setuptools`?

`easypypi` is a simplified, one-size-fits-all solution that caters for 87.3% of use cases, particular if you've never published to PyPI and just want a starting point that brings everything down to the lowest common denominator and spares you from making choices and researching scenarios that just don't matter yet.

(*) It took me 3 years to realise I was pronouncing this wrong!  "Pie-Pea-Eye" in case you didn't know.  And why should you?
