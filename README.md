`easyPyPI` (Pronounced "Easy Pie-Pea-Eye") is a quick, simple, one-size-fits-all solution for sharing your Python creations on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (**PyPI**) so others can just `pip install yourscript` with no fuss.

`easyPyPI` is mainly intended for Pythonistas who've been put off publishing to **PyPI** before now or tried it but, like the author (pictured below) thought:

> "*There **must** be an easier way to do this!*"

Well now there is.  Just install `easyPyPI`, run it, and follow the prompts.  No knowledge of `setuptools`, `twine`, or how to write a `setup.py` script required.

    pip install easypypi
    python.exe -m easypypi

With `easyPyPI` you don't have to spend hours...

- Reading tutorials about `distutils` only to find `setuptools` is what you need.
- Reading yet more tutorials just to work out the essential steps (below).
- Manually creating a folder structure and moving your script(s) there.
- Manually creating a skeleton `README.md`
- Manually creating a skeleton `__init__.py`
- Manually creating a skeleton `test_yourscript.py`
- Manually creating a `LICENSE`
- Manually creating `setup.py` and wondering what on earth to put in it
- Remembering to update your Version number each time
- Running `setup.py` in just the right way to create your distribution files
- Installing and running `twine` in just the right way to upload your package to **Test PyPI** / **PyPI**

Enjoy!
