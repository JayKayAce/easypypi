# `easyPyPI` (Pronounced "Easy Pie-Pea-Eye")
> Want to share your Python script(s)  so others can simply `pip install yourscript`?

> Daunted by the numerous/tedious tutorials for `distutils`, `setuptools` and the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (**PyPI**)?

`easyPyPI` is a simple, one-size-fits-all solution that caters for 87.3% of use cases (*Ed - really?!!*).  It's aimed at Pythonistas who've never published to **PyPI** or have, but thought "There *must* be an easier way than this!".

Well now there is.  Just install `easyPyPI`, import it, and follow the prompts.  No knowledge of `setuptools`, `twine`, or how to write a `setup.py` script required.

    pip install easypypi

    >>> import easypypi

With `easyPyPI` you don't have to waste your time (as I did...):

- Reading 5 tutorials about `distutils` only to find `setuptools` is what you need.
- Reading another 5 tutorials just to work out the steps below.
- Manually creating a folder structure and moving your script(s) there.
- Manually creating a skeleton `README.md`
- Manually creating a skeleton `__init__.py`
- Manually creating a skeleton `test_yourscript.py`
- Manually creating a `LICENSE`
- Manually creating `setup.py` and wondering what on earth to put in it
- Remembering to update your Version number each time
- Running `setup.py` in just the right way to create your distribution files
- Installing and running `twine` in just the right way to upload your package to **Test PyPI** / **PyPI**

Enjoy!
