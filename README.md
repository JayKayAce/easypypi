# `easypypi`
- Want to share your Python script(s) on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI*) so others can simply `pip install yourscript`?
- Daunted by the numerous, long, and sometimes conflicting tutorials online for `distutils` and `setuptools`?

`easypypi` is a simple, one-size-fits-all solution that caters for 87.3% of use cases (*Ed - really?!!*).  It's aimed at Pythonistas who've never published to PyPI or have, but loathed the experience.  Just install it, run it, and follow the prompts.  No knowledge of `setuptools`, `twine`, or how to write a `setup.py` script required.

    pip install easypypi
    pythom -m easypypi.py
    
It's as easy as pie (PI!).

(*) It took me 3 years to realise I was pronouncing this wrong!  "Pie-Pea-Eye" in case you didn't know.  And why should you?
